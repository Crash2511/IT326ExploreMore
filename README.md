: Our program works by using the XAMPP database which can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/
: After getting a functional database the user can create a account by registering. After the user has registered
they user can log in by clicking the login button again. One logged in the user is granted with a blank homescreen. 
If the user chooses to enter no location the program will automatically detect a general location and build a schdule around that area.
The user is allowed to select from a total of eight different filters on the sidebar and the program to better suit their interests.
When the schedule is displayed to the user it shows a timeslot for the location, its location type, and the rating for it. 
The user is free to reroll or delete a schedule at any given time. If the user wants to save their schedule they can do so by using the export 
feature to download or share their schedule. 
: Some notable features of the app are the list view which creates a mini list of the schedule making it easier to view.
We also have buttons for deletion and updating of user data so that the end users are always in control of their data. 
One added security feature is the accountlock feature where after 10 failed attempts of logging in the system will block the
user from logging in again and randomize their password. The user then must go through the resetpassword process which will send them
and email with a verification code to allow them to change their password again.
